        <summary><strong>Short Bio</strong> (Quick overview)</summary>
        <p>
          João Melo is a Brazilian percussionist and educator pursuing a double
          major in Percussion Performance and Philosophy at Bard College in New
          York. A first-generation college student from Salvador, Bahia, João
          began his journey in the music and social project NEOJIBA, where he
          developed a deep commitment to music as a tool for empowerment and
          transformation.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Bard, João performs in orchestras, chamber ensembles, and solo
          settings, mentors young musicians, and works in audiovisual and event
          production. He is known for blending classical repertoire with
          Afro-Brazilian traditions and has led workshops exploring the
          historical and spiritual roots of Ijexá and Samba Reggae.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2025, João was selected as a fellow of the OAcademy Orchestra
          Institute. His story is marked by persistence, creativity, and a
          community-centered vision. His senior project connects philosophy,
          education, and music, and he is developing a community initiative

          João Melo is a Brazilian percussionist, educator, and student at Bard
          College in New York, where he is pursuing a double major in Percussion
          Performance and Philosophy. A first-generation college student, João
          came to the U.S. on a full scholarship after beginning his musical
          journey through the social program NEOJIBA in Salvador, Bahia.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Bard, João has distinguished himself as both a performer and a
          leader. He performs regularly with the Bard Conservatory Orchestra and
          Bard Percussion Ensemble, mentors through the Musical Mentorship
          Initiative, and works in AV and stage production. His senior project
          brings together the philosophies of Hannah Arendt and Paulo Freire
          with Afro-Brazilian music traditions like Ijexá and Samba Reggae.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2025, João joined the OAcademy Orchestra Institute, expanding his
          global network and solidifying his artistic voice. He is currently
          developing a community arts project in Salvador that connects youth

        <p>
          João Melo is a Brazilian percussionist, educator, and
          interdisciplinary thinker currently pursuing a double major in
          Percussion Performance and Philosophy at Bard College in New York. As
          a first-generation international student on a full scholarship, João’s
          work lies at the intersection of music, community empowerment, and
          reflective inquiry.
        </p>
        <p>
          He began his musical journey in Salvador, Bahia, through the social
          project NEOJIBA, where he discovered how music could be a powerful
          tool for transformation. His background in Afro-Brazilian rhythms and
          classical training informs a style rooted in both precision and
          communal experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Bard, João performs extensively, mentors young musicians, and works
          in production roles. He has led workshops on Afro-Brazilian rhythms
          like Ijexá and Samba Reggae. In 2025, João was selected for the
          OAcademy Orchestra Institute, years after an earlier rejection led him
          down the path that brought him to Bard.
        </p>
        <p>
          His senior project bridges the thought of Hannah Arendt and Paulo
          Freire with cultural knowledge from Salvador’s percussion scene. João
          is currently developing a community-based project in Salvador
          connecting youth and elders through percussion and storytelling.
          Fluent in English and Portuguese, he envisions art as a path to
          justice and healing.
