        <p>
          João Melo is a Brazilian percussionist and educator pursuing a double
          major in Percussion Performance and Philosophy at Bard College in New
          York. A first-generation college student from Salvador, Bahia, João
          began his journey in the music and social project NEOJIBA, where he
          developed a commitment to music as a tool for empowerment and
          transformation.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Bard, João performs in orchestras, chamber ensembles, and solo
          concerts, teaches through mentorship programs, and works in event
          production and audiovisual operations. He is known for mixing
          classical repertoire with Afro-Brazilian traditions and has organized
          collaborative projects such as rhythm workshops exploring the
          spiritual and political roots of Ijexá and Samba Reggae.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2025, João was selected as a fellow of the OAcademy Orchestra
          Institute, a program he has been participating in masterclasses,
          orchestra studies, etc. His story is marked by persistence,
          creativity, and community-centered vision.
        </p>
        <p>
          His senior project at Bard connects philosophy, education, and music,
          exploring the works of Hannah Arendt and Paulo Freire in relation to
          Salvador’s percussion traditions. João is also developing a community
          arts initiative that connects youth with elders through rhythm and
          storytelling, aiming to promote peace and intergenerational
          responsibility through art.

        <p>
          João Melo is a Brazilian percussionist, educator, and student at Bard
          College in New York, where he is pursuing a double major in Percussion
          Performance and Philosophy. A first-generation college student, João
          came to the U.S. on a full scholarship after his musical journey began
          in the social program NEOJIBA in Salvador, Bahia. There, he was
          exposed to the transformative power of music in community contexts,
          especially within Afro-Brazilian traditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Bard, João has distinguished himself as both a performer and a
          leader. He plays regularly with the Bard Conservatory Orchestra and
          Bard Percussion Ensemble, mentors young musicians through the Musical
          Mentorship Initiative, and works across departments in audiovisual
          support and stage production. These roles have helped his ability to
          move between technical precision and creative intuition.
        </p>
        <p>
          João is passionate about connecting academic study with lived
          experience. His senior project at Bard brings together Hannah Arendt’s
          ideas on education with Paulo Freire’s pedagogy and Afro-Brazilian
          musical practices. He is especially interested in the social,
          spiritual, and political meaning of Brazilian rhythms, like Ijexá and
          Samba Reggae, which he has presented in educational workshops that
          highlight the role in Black cultural resistance.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2025, João was accepted into the OAcademy Orchestra Institute, a
          prestigious international training program that improved his global
          network and solidified his artistic voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          João is currently working on a community arts project in Salvador,
          aimed at bringing together youth and elders through percussion, visual
          art, and collective storytelling. His dream is to create spaces where
          art becomes a path toward responsibility, identity, and healing.

        <summary><strong>Full Bio</strong> (Complete version)</summary>
        <p>
          João Melo is a Brazilian percussionist, educator, and
          interdisciplinary thinker currently pursuing a double major in
          Percussion Performance and Philosophy at Bard College in New York. As
          a first-generation international student on a full scholarship, João’s
          work lies at the connection of music, community empowerment, and
          reflective inquiry.
        </p>
        <p>
          He began his musical journey in Salvador, Bahia, through the social
          project NEOJIBA, where he first experienced how music could serve as a
          powerful tool for social transformation. His early exposure to
          Afro-Brazilian rhythms, community-based music education, and ensemble
          work gave him a deep commitment to equity, education, and artistic
          excellence. João’s style connects classical training with the communal
          traditions of Afro-Brazilian music.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Bard, João has cultivated a diverse profile: he performs as an
          orchestral and chamber musician, teaches through mentorship programs,
          and works behind the scenes in stage management and audio-visual
          operations. He has also taken initiative as a cultural connector,
          organizing collaborative projects such as delivering educational
          workshops on Brazilian rhythms like Ijexá and Samba Reggae,
          highlighting their historical and political contexts.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2025, João was selected as a fellow of the OAcademy Orchestra
          Institute, marking a full-circle moment since being rejected from the
          program in 2019, a setback that indirectly led to his acceptance at
          Bard through a partner organization. His journey reflects resilience
          and a commitment to growth, transformation, and building connections
          across disciplines and cultures.
        </p>
        <p>
          João’s senior project at Bard explores Hannah Arendt's philosophical
          insights on education and political life with Brazilian thinkers like
          Paulo Freire and the cultural knowledge of Salvador’s percussion
          traditions. His vision is to use art not as a product, but as a
          process for healing, collective responsibility, and liberation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of performance and academia, João is invested in creating
          meaningful connections, whether through cooking meals with friends,
          mentoring younger students, or using social media as a platform to
          share his journey authentically. He is currently developing a
          community-based arts initiative in Salvador aimed at reconnecting
          youth and elders through percussion, storytelling, and sculpture
        </p>
        <p>
          Fluent in English and Portuguese, João continues to challenge the
          boundaries of what it means to be an artist in the 21st century. He
          dreams of a future where his music not only moves audiences but moves
          communities toward justice and self-knowledge.
